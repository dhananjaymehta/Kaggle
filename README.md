### 1. Digit Recognition

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. 
In this project my goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. Have used three different algorithms for classification: 

1. Support Vector Machines
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest
4. Clustering
